      "1.  **Analyze the user's request:** The user is asking \"What is the meaning of life?\" This is one of the most profound, philosophical, and subjective questions in human history. It's not a factual question with a single, objective answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Identify the nature of the question:**\n",
      "    *   **Philosophical:** It touches on ethics, metaphysics, and purpose.\n",
      "    *   **Existential:** It deals with the search for significance.\n",
      "    *   **Scientific:** Evolutionary biology offers a perspective (reproduction, survival).\n",
      "    *   **Personal:** The answer is ultimately up to the individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Brainstorm potential perspectives/answers:**\n",
      "    *   *Biological/Evolutionary:* To survive, to reproduce, to pass on genes.\n",
      "    *   *Philosophical (Nihilism):* No inherent meaning; life is absurd; we create our own meaning.\n",
      "    *   *Philosophical (Existentialism):* Existence precedes essence; we are free to define our own purpose.\n",
      "    *   *Philosophical (Religious/Spiritual):* To serve a higher power, to achieve enlightenment, to prepare for an afterlife, to fulfill a divine plan.\n",
      "    *   *Psychological/Humanistic:* To seek happiness, to connect with others, to contribute to society, to learn and grow.\n",
      "    *   *Pop Culture:* \"To live and to let live\" (Monty Python), \"42\" (Douglas Adams).\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Structure the response:**\n",
      "    *   **Acknowledge the complexity:** Start by stating that there is no single, universally agreed-upon answer.\n",
      "    *   **Categorize the perspectives:** Group the brainstormed points into logical categories (Biological, Philosophical, Personal).\n",
      "    *   **Draft the content for each category:**\n",
      "        *   *Biological:* Survival and reproduction.\n",
      "        *   *Philosophical (Existentialism):* Creating your own meaning.\n",
      "        *   *Religious/Spiritual:* Connection to the divine or higher power.\n",
      "        *   *Humanistic:* Connection, contribution, happiness.\n",
      "    *   **Conclude with a synthesis:** Emphasize that the meaning is subjective and personal.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Refine the tone:** The tone should be respectful, thoughtful, and balanced. Avoid being preachy or dismissive.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Drafting the content (Iterative refinement):**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   *Drafting the Biological part:* Keep it simple. \"To survive and reproduce.\" Mention evolution.\n",
      "    *   *Drafting the Philosophical part:* Focus on Existentialism (Sartre, Camus). \"We are born without purpose, so we must create it.\"\n",
      "    *   *Drafting the Religious part:* Briefly mention that for many, it's about faith or a higher purpose.\n",
      "    *   *Drafting the Personal part:* This is the most important part for the user. \"It depends on you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **Review against safety guidelines:** Does this promote self-harm or hate speech? No. Is it controversial? It touches on religion, but it presents it as a perspective, not a fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.  **Final Polish (similar to the generated output):**\n",
      "    *   Start with the \"42\" joke? Maybe too cliché, but a nod to it is fun. Let's stick to a serious but comprehensive answer first.\n",
      "    *   Use bullet points for readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "    *(Self-Correction during drafting)*: Make sure not to sound like I'm giving *the* answer. Use phrases like \"From a biological perspective...\" or \"Many philosophers believe...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9.  **Final Output Generation:** (This matches the provided good response.)\n",
      "    *   Introduction: No single answer.\n",
      "    *   1. Biological: Survival/Reproduction.\n",
      "    *   2. Existentialism: Create your own.\n",
      "    *   3. Religious/Spiritual: Divine purpose.\n",
      "    *   4. Humanistic: Connection/Happiness.\n",
      "    *   Conclusion: It's a journey, not a destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Final check:** Does this answer the prompt? Yes. Is it helpful? Yes. Is it safe? Yes.</think>The question \"What is the meaning of life?\" is one of the oldest and most profound questions in human history. Because it is subjective, there is no single, universally agreed-upon answer. However, different fields of thought offer different perspectives:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. The Biological Perspective**\n",
      "From an evolutionary standpoint, the meaning of life is simply to survive and reproduce. The goal of every living organism is to pass on its genes to the next generation to ensure the continuation of the species.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. The Existentialist Perspective**\n",
      "Existentialist philosophers (such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus) argue that the universe has no inherent meaning. Therefore, we are \"condemned to be free.\" This means we are not born with a pre-written script; rather, we must create our own meaning through our choices, actions, and values.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. The Religious and Spiritual Perspective**\n",
      "For many, life has meaning because it is part of a larger divine plan. This could mean serving a higher power, achieving enlightenment, preparing for an afterlife, or fulfilling a specific destiny or purpose given by a creator.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. The Humanistic Perspective**\n",
      "This view focuses on human potential and well-being. The meaning of life is often found in:\n",
      "*   **Connection:** Building relationships with others.\n",
      "*   **Contribution:** Helping society, your community, or the environment.\n",
      "*   **Self-Actualization:** Pursuing personal growth, creativity, and happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. The \"42\" Perspective**\n",
      "In Douglas Adams' *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, a supercomputer calculates the answer to the \"Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything\" to be **42**. However, the computer explains that because the question itself was poorly phrased, the answer is meaningless without the correct question.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Summary**\n",
      "Ultimately, the meaning of life is whatever you decide it is. It is not something you find; it is something you create.\n"
